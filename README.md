Terrier implements state-of-the-art indexing and retrieval functionalities, and provides an ideal platform for the rapid development and evaluation of large-scale retrieval applications.

Terrier is open source, and is a comprehensive, flexible and transparent platform for research and experimentation in text retrieval. [Research can easily be carried out](http://terrier.org/doc/current/bibliography.html) on standard [TREC](http://trec.nist.gov/) and [CLEF](http://www.clef-initiative.eu/) test collections.

Terrier is written in Java, and is developed at the School of Computing Science, [University of Glasgow](http://www.gla.ac.uk/).
